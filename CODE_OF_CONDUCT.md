## Expectations of Visitors and Contributors
We expect all visitors and contributors to easey-ui to have a safe and engaging experience that is beneficial to our community. Members of our community have a diverse set of experiences and skillsets. As you engage our community, please ensure you are:

- Collaborative: the essences of open source is collaborative in nature. Attempt to honor the spirit of open source by working together before conflict.
- Patient: Remember that open source is a culture change in government and while easey-ui is a testament to that change, change is occurring thanks to many in this community. Be patient if your question or issue is not answered right away. Many are juggling multiple duties. Contributing to open source projects is often an after hours affair.

- Using clear communication: We donâ€™t all speak the same language. Further, written, or typed words lack tone or body language to help interpret intent or meaning. If your words could have more than one meaning, take time to be clearer and always air on the side of being kind.
